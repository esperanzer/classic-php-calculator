# Classic PHP Calculator

A simple calculator built in **PHP** to practice core programming concepts.

## 📌 About the Project
This is a **command-line PHP calculator** that allows users to:
- Add two numbers
- Subtract two numbers
- Multiply two numbers
- Divide two numbers (with error checking for division by zero)

It’s called **classic** because it’s the most basic form of a calculator project — a perfect way to practice **functions, variables, input/output, and error handling**.
